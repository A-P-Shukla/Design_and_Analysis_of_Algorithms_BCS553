## List of Experiments

This repository contains the C programs for the following experiments:

1.  **Searching Algorithms:**
    - **Linear Search (Recursive):** A simple search technique that checks every element sequentially until the target is found.
    - **Binary Search (Recursive):** An efficient search on sorted arrays that repeatedly divides the search interval in half.

2.  **Simple Sorting:**
    - **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly moving unsorted elements to their correct position.
    - **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    - **Selection Sort:** Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning.

3.  **Divide and Conquer:**
    - **Merge Sort:** A stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
    - **Quick Sort:** Picks an element as a 'pivot' and partitions the array around it, such that smaller elements are on the left and larger on the right.

4.  **Heap and Non-Comparison Sort:**
    - **Heap Sort:** Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements, offering a balance between performance and memory efficiency.
    - **Counting Sort:** A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that counts occurrences of each unique value to determine positions.

5.  **Radix and Shell Sort:**
    - **Radix Sort:** Sorts numbers digit by digit from least significant to most significant using a stable subroutine like Counting Sort.
    - **Shell Sort:** An optimization of Insertion Sort that allows swapping of far-apart elements to reduce the total number of moves.

6.  **Greedy Algorithms:**
    - **Activity Selection Problem:** Selects the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed by a single person.
    - **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Finds the most valuable combination of items (including fractions) that fit within a knapsack's weight limit.

7.  **Dynamic Programming:**
    - **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Determines the maximum value of items that can be carried in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity, where items cannot be split.
    - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences, useful in comparing data patterns.

8.  **Minimum Spanning Trees:**
    - **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Finds the minimum spanning tree by sorting all edges and adding them one by one if they don't form a cycle.
    - **Prim’s Algorithm:** Grows the minimum spanning tree from a starting vertex by repeatedly adding the cheapest edge to a new vertex.

9.  **Shortest Paths:**
    - **Warshall's (Floyd-Warshall) Algorithm:** Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
    - **Dijkstra Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

10. **Backtracking:**
    - **N-Queen Problem:** Positions N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
    - **Sum of Subset Problem:** Finds a subset of a given set of numbers whose sum equals a specified target value.
